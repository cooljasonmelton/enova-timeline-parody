## Enova Timeline... Parody? 

### what is this?
I've recreated a timeline feature I found on this <a href='https://www.enova.com/company/'>page</a> However, instead of showing off the history of Enova, my version shows the history of me discovering apple and cheese sandwiches.

### features
- near perfect recreation of Enova's navbar without functionality--for display only, only thing on it that works is the little arrow next 'investor relations' flips upside down.
- near perfect recreation of timeline with updated years. Now with 2019! Years respond to click, animating to a larger size.
- cards display the history of me discovering and eating apple and cheese sandwiches, transition on and off page corresponding to passage through time.

### also
I don't own the copyright to any images. I am not trying to make any money off this. Just learn and earn brownie points if I'm ever interviewed. If it's an issue, get ahold of me (email below). I'll remove them.
