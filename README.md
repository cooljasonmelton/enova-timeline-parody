## Enova Timeline... Parody? I'm Not Sure

### what is this?
I am recreating a timeline feature I found on this <a href='https://www.enova.com/company/'>page</a>.

### features
- near perfect recreation of Enova's navbar--for display only, only thing on it that works is the little arrow next investor relations flips upside down.
- near perfect recreation of timeline with updated years. Now with 2019! Years respond to click, animating to a larger size.

### also
I don't own the copyright to any images. I am not making any money off this. If it's an issue, email me, and I'll remove them.
